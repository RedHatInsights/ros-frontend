# Resource Optimization Service (Frontend)

Resource Optimization is a service that can help you optimize your public cloud workloads on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Read more about it [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/optimize-public-cloud-workloads-rhel-red-hat-insights-resource-optimization)

## Prerequisites

### Install

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


## Setup Development Environment

1. Clone below repositories:

```
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome.git
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy.git
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/ros-frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/ros-backend.git
```

Note that below file paths are based on assumption that all repositories are cloned in same folder.


2. Make sure you meet the prerequisites mentioned in both frontend and backend repositories.

3. To run the whole dev setup, you will need to run commands in multiple terminal tabs.

[TAB 1] Insights Proxy TAB -
Follow steps from [here](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-frontend-storybook/blob/master/src/docs/welcome/quickStart/DOC.md#proxy)
i.e

```
cd ../insights-proxy
npm install
sudo bash scripts/patch-etc-hosts.sh
bash scripts/update.sh
```

[TAB 2] Insights Chrome TAB -
Wait for insights-proxy to finish update script then follow steps from [here](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-frontend-storybook/blob/master/src/docs/welcome/quickStart/DOC.md#chrome)
i.e

```
cd ../insights-chrome
npm install
npm run build
```

Open new tab [TAB 3]: ie. for ros-frontend (In case of local ros-backend server)

Make sure current directory is `ros-frontend`. Open the project in any editor. Add below route change in the file `ros-frontend/profiles/local-frontend.js` after `routes[`/apps/${APP_ID}`]`

```
routes['/api/ros/v0']                = { host: 'http://localhost:8000' };
routes['/api/inventory/v1']          = { host: 'http://localhost:8001' };
```

Go to [TAB 1] :
Make sure current directory is `insights-proxy`
Run command -

```
SPANDX_CONFIG=../ros-frontend/profiles/local-frontend.js sh scripts/run.sh
```

[TAB 3] ROS Frontend TAB -
Wait till the above steps finish their execution.

```
cd ../ros-frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

4. Follow the steps mentioned under the [ros-backend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/ros-backend) repository for setting up local backend server.

5. Once both frontend & backend setup is up and running, go to browser and access it using `https://{ci/qa}.foo.redhat.com:1337/insights/ros` link.


## Running the Tests


Tests can be executed with:

```
npm run test
```

Few tests are [Snapshot tests](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) used to verify that current test output matches a snapshot taken before. If these changes are legitimate, the snapshots need to be updated with:

```
npm run test -- -u
```



## Running the lint

```
// to run lint
npm run lint

// to fix lint errors
npm run lint:js:fix

```

## Deployment

Please refer this [link](https://clouddot.pages.redhat.com/docs/dev/getting-started/deploying-frontend.html)

### Major Dependencies used in the Project

- [Insights-Proxy](#insights-proxy)
- [Spandx](#spandx)
- [Insights-Chrome](#insights-chrome)
- [Patternfly](#patternfly)
- [Frontend-Components](#frontend-components)

### Insights-Proxy

[insights-proxy](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy) - Proxy for the insights frontend container


### Spandx

[spandx](https://github.com/redhataccess/spandx) is an HTTP switchboard. It can be used to weave together pieces of a large, complex website by choosing which resources should come from the local system and which should come from a remote environment.

For example, spandx can be pointed to production, but route `/static/js` to a local directory, which allows testing local JS against the production environment. Code in production, it's fun!

More technically, spandx is a flexible, configuration-based reverse proxy for local development.

### Insights-Chrome

[insights-chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome)- The "wrapper" around your application!

Insights Chrome provides:

- Standard header and navigation
- Base CSS/style
- A JavaScript library for interacting with Insights Chrome


### Patternfly

[PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/v4/) is an open source design system created to enable consistency and usability across a wide range of applications and use cases. PatternFly provides clear standards, guidance, and tools that help designers and developers work together more efficiently and build better user experiences.

### Frontend-Components

[Frontend-components](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components) is a monorepo of Red Hat Cloud services Components for applications in a React.js environment. This repo uses a lot of components imported from the frontend-components repo.
